# Advent of Code 2021

These are my implementations for Advent of Code 2021, as I learn Elixir (and related tooling) from scratch.  They ain't necessarily right, and they come with years of programming baggage in other languages, some functional.

## Running

```sh
# Run tests to guarantee implementation
mix test

# Get answers to all days
mix escript.build
./aoc
```
